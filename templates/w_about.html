                        <p>A symptom checker is a tool that allows users to enter symptoms, as well as other medical and demographic information, to get a list of possible medical conditions. Symptom checkers can be used as a starting point to get a medical diagnosis from a doctor. Whether you have a sore throat, an itch, a bad case of sneezes, abdominal pain, or fatigue, you can enter these common symptoms to explore their potential causes.</p>

                </div>

                        <p>While it’s not a substitute for professional medical advice, you can get a better idea of what might be causing that sore throat or abdominal pain. Our symptom checker utilizes sophisticated natural language processing software that is applied to a medical database of disease information consisting of thousands of different health conditions. You’ll be asked to enter your symptoms using everyday language and answer a few basic questions about your health, age, sex, and location. The combination of symptoms and health information is analyzed by an enhanced machine learning model that produces a list of possible matching conditions, such as the flu or many other ailments. You can then research those conditions and locate doctors to help diagnose and treat them.</p>

                        <p>Symptom checkers are used by doctors and medical group members in hospitals around the world to help diagnose patients with ailments, such as COVID-19, the flu, or even a severe menstrual period. Our tool is widely recognized in the medical community as one of the most accurate on the market and has been professionally validated over many years with several peer-reviewed articles appearing in medical journals.</p>

                        <p>A symptom checker is not a substitute for seeing a doctor. It is a tool to help gather information and determine what type of doctor to see in order to have a more productive visit with the goal of getting the correct diagnosis sooner. Whether that’s intense cramps from a menstrual period or a case of COVID-19, our symptom checking tool can help.<br><br>Reported that for people living with a rare disease, it takes an average of nearly 5 years between onset of symptoms and correct diagnosis. In that time, they see an average of over 7 physicians each.  And over half of patients agreed with the statement, “Because of a slow diagnosis, treatment was delayed and the impact on my condition has been negative.” MediFind aims to speed up the process of finding the correct diagnosis with the help of your physician.</p>

                        <p>There are very few symptoms that indicate just one condition and most symptoms have many potential causes. It is not possible, even with sophisticated technology, to narrow down the list of conditions to one or two. A symptom checker is designed to allow patients to research possible conditions in order to be prepared when consulting with a doctor. Whether you’re researching symptoms across a specific body area or you want to know more about the differences between a coronavirus and the flu, the symptom tool may show multiple results.</p>

                        <p>Say you get results that list COVID-19, the flu, and a cold. Does this mean you’re more likely to have COVID-19 over the flu? No. The order of the condition results is sorted by relevance or word match and does NOT indicate the degree of clinical likelihood. Please review all the conditions rather than focusing on just the first condition.</p>
